## Technologies & Languages

Throughout the development of these projects, I've utilized a diverse set of programming languages and technologies to tackle various aspects of computer science, from algorithmic challenges to web development. Here's a summary of the primary languages and tools:

- **Languages**:
  - **C**: Essential for low-level programming tasks, algorithmic challenges, and data structures.
  - **HTML**: The backbone of web projects, used to structure the content of web pages.
  - **Python**: A versatile language for backend development, data analysis, and scripting.
  - **CSS**: Styles web pages to improve user interface and experience.
  - **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to web pages, making them dynamic and engaging for users.

- **Technologies/Tools**:
  - **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework for building web applications.
  - **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
  - **jQuery**: Simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, and animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development.
  - **SQL**: Used to manage databases, execute queries, and process data for web applications.
  - **SQLite**: A lightweight, disk-based database that simplifies the process of database management without the need for a separate server.

These languages and tools were strategically chosen to build a broad range of applications, demonstrating my ability to solve complex problems and develop scalable, user-friendly software.
