Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
I couldn't get this right. :(

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
same for this one.
