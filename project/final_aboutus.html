<h3> About Us </h3>
<p> This website is designed for people to look-up their symptoms
    and direct them to the right place to receive quality care.
we've all been through it, we experience symptoms but don't know where to go to seek care
 or been to a situation where we've been in a waiting room for 8 hours
only to find out our primary care doctor could've taken care of our issue
or went to an urgent care for a chest pain with a history of heart attack only for them to call 911 and get transported in the ER.
whatever your issue today, we're here to lead you to the right resources for better health. </p>
