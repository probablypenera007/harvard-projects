sort1 uses: BUBBLE SORT

random 10,000 took 0.288s
sort 10,000 took 0.067s

How do you know?: the amount of time for Random and Sorted got solved is very drastic, based on my understanding with Bubble Sort it tends to do that.


//

sort2 uses: MERGE SORT

random 10,000 took 0.053s
sort 10,000 took 0.055s

How do you know?: the amount of time the Random part and the Sort part got sorted is the fastest, based on my understanding with Merge Sort it's the fastest sorting algorithm to do that.

//

sort3 uses: SELECTION SORT

random 10,000 took 0.222s
sort 10,000 took 0.169s


How do you know?: to be honest, this is a lucky guess since it's the last one of the three choices.
